# i'm sorry to know that you're here man smh
***coding is a fun hobby to me so don't expect high quality stuff on here but fun scripts i enjoy writing***

- hi call me bewbs
- i am so into "useful" programming rather than the silly todo apps thrown here and there
- if im not coding im internally screaming at my horrible code BUT IT WORKS
- i blog about nerdy stuff on my medium 
- uh and if you couldn't tell by now, i am terrible at being funny 

I mainly code in : 
1. JS
2. Python 
3. Ruby, very recently and will prolly spend tons of times before it becomes boring

Automation wise i love bash scripting, i find it insanely useful 

Things i enjoy making 
Honestly anything that has anything to do with automation, stuff like discord bots, reddit bots, creating cron jobs to automate personal scripts, user scripts, bookmarklets, you get the idea

Let's chat on discord if you wanna learn to code with me - i am pretty smart....sometimes - 

HAVE A LOVELY DAY
